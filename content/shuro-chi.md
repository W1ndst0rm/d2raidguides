## Guide in progress

## Lore

Shuro Chi is the third of the Techeons who were taken by Oryx. Like Sedia and Kalli we must defeat her and gain her aid. She sings a song to tempt us from our mission. If she finishes her song the guardians die.

## Mechanics

### Layout and Enemies

The arena has three levels or floors. Each level has two sections where Shuro Chi can be damaged. She stands in the center of the large circular platform with three smaller raised plates around the outside edge. The small plates do enough damage to any guardian standing on them to kill you in a handful of seconds. The first two floors also have a puzzle room that serves as the transition up to the next floor.

{{< figure src="/images/shuro-chi-plates.png" title="Shuro Chi stands in the center of the three plates">}}

In addition to her song, Shuro Chi has the same attacks as the other taken Techeons. She has a bolt that does a significant amount of damage. She also uses an attack to knock guardians vertically in the air before pushing them away with a scream. She is also surrounded by a shield that must be lowered before she can be damaged. She summons waves of taken to defend her while she sings.

The enemies are mostly Taken thrall and knights. There are phalanxes in the puzzle room and an ogre between the two large platforms on each floor.

There is a special enemy that spawns near each large plate called an Eye of Riven. It is a yellow health bar Taken Captain with a solar shield. Upon death it drops an orb call 'Taken Essence'. The orb can be used to attack enemies and has a super ability that can be used to interrupt Shuro Chi.

### Debuffs and Timers

Shuro Chi’s Song - When this countdown reaches zero Shuro Chi finishes her song and wipes the entire fireteam.

Taken Essence Antumbra/Penumbra - This debuff is gained by picking up the orb dropped by the Eye of Riven. As long as a guardian is holding the orb, the number of stacks increases every few seconds. If the number of stacks reaches x10, the guardian will die. This debuff persists after the guardian is no longer holding the orb until it’s countdown timer reaches zero. If a guardian has this debuff, they cannot pick up the orb dropped by the Eye of Riven.

### Lowering Shuro Chi’s Shields

After all the waves of taken have been killed, crystals will appear above the three small plates. Standing on a plate allows a guardian holding a crystal to shoot out a narrow beam of light. To lower Shuro Chi’s shield, three guardians should each pick up a crystal. They then must form a triangle around her by each shooting the next guardian around the triangle.

### Puzzle Room

Completing this room allows a large hemispherical “cups” to swing down to a position where they can be used to ascend to the next floor. To complete the puzzle there are three symbols in the room positioned midway up the walls that must be completed. Only one symbol is visible and active at a time. Each symbol can be subdivided into a 3x3 grid, but four of the grid pieces are missing. The four missing pieces must be filled in to complete the symbol and advance to the next. Matching the grid on the symbols, there is also a 3x3 grid of small elevated plates in the center of the room. Activating the correct four plates, by standing on them simultaneously, fills in the missing pieces of the puzzle. Each plate corresponds to a piece of the symbol. The plates are relative to the frame of reference of the active symbol. When looking at the wall with the symbol, the plate in the top left will fill in the top left of the piece of the puzzle. Each guardian can only activate a plate one time.
