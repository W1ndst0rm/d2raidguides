# Lore

Kalli is one of the three Techeuns that was taken by Oryx during the attack on his dreadnaught in Destiny 1. We need her help to defeat Riven, so like Sedia in the Corrupted strike we need to free her from the taken influence by defeating her.

# Mechanics

To complete this encounter you need to defeat Kalli before she kills you. The main way she does this is by “conceiving an ontological weapon” and wielding it against you. It is an instant kill on any guardian that isn’t safely inside one of the doors that open under Kalli right before she wields her weapon.

Only one guardian can be inside each door, so six doors must be opened. This is done by standing on the plates in a rough circle around the outside edge of the arena. There are nine plates, six of them will open doors and three of them summon ogres in the center of the arena.

The three symbols hung in pairs indicate which plate to stand on. Each outer plate will open three doors in the section under the matching inner symbol pair. When a matching plate has been successfully cleansed, one of the hanging symbols in the center will disappear.

To cleanse one of the plates a guardian must stand on it until a taken knight appears and then kill the knight. To complicate this, two of the three sections of the plate are slowly taken until they explode, killing any guardian standing in the taken portion. After the explosion the un-taken section will move and two sections will begin to be taken. While the plates are active, taken thrall spawn throughout the arena. Kalli will also randomly visit the plates and attack the guardians. Shooting her in the head will make her leave.

After the plates have been cleansed, Kalli will appear under one of the pairs of symbols. She will attack the guardians and begin to summon her weapon. Shortly after the text “Kalli prepares to wield her weapon” appears on screen, the doors will open in section underneath her. Everyone has a few seconds to get inside an unoccupied room before Kalli uses her weapon. The doors will then open and Kalli will move to underneath a different pair of symbols. While the guardians are shut behind the doors, taken psions will spawn in the center of the arena.

After Kalli has appeared under each pair of symbols and used her weapon each time, she will return to roaming the room. At this point the plates reset and must be cleansed again. They inner set of hanging symbols may change, requiring a different set of plates to be cleansed.
